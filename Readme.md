### Healthy Nurse Network

-----
### Overview

* This is a Website/ CMS which is aimed at curating information useful for nurses wanting to
live a healthy life, under unique, challenging working conditions.

My wife is a Neonatal ICU (NICU) Nurse. The work is demanding, the hours long, and the pay is not substantial. Night shift
makes is a lot worse. Most of her colleagues deal with a large number of health issues, but not successfully.

This site will look to curate resources for them.

### Technical

Initially, this will be a static site, but I hope to add functionality over time, that would benefit the users of the site (nurses, or
any other person looking to optimize their health under demanding conditions).
